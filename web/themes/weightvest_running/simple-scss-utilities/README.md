This is a work in Progress!
Docs will be available at https://bthvedt.github.io/simple-scss-utilities-docs/

The goal is to develop an SCSS framework that doesn't try to be everything, but still useful enough to get rid of 90% of plain CSS. It doesn't build every component for you, surely you can make a button or a navbar or a modal, etc..

.. and it doesn't try to provide every option under the sun. Just utility classes and an easily customizable scss variables file. Fast to learn, easy to modify, doesn't get in your way. This is for the developer who wants to build their own components and get a little creative without having to worry if it's "the right way to use the framework".

I'm tinkering with it now, and hope to have it up soon! Next step will be a library of component examples, with an emphasis on on accessibility.
