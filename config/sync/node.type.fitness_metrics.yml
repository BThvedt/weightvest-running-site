description: "A non-running metric of various exercises. I read somewhere that 40 is the point of diminishing returns for pushups, so I'm just gonna assume it's true for everything else too. Very scientific. Once I hit 40 in an exercise, I'll add weight. Probably gonna be a while before I hit 40 pullups. "
